django-fixture-shell
====================

An app allowing you to easily create fixtures from the command line using a
django shell.



Usage
-----

``fixture_shell outfile [app1 [, app2]``

The `outfile` is where the fixture should be written to, due to the interactive
nature of this command, the fixture is written to a file rather than to stdout.

You may provide an optional list of apps to create fixtures of (same as for
dumpdata).
